# Full Stack Flask API

A Journal Entry type Schema with the following fields: 
id, title, content

POST route
* Post should require the journal title and the content
GET route
* Get should dump and return all records
DELETE route

I do not want a form on the front end to post data. Interact with your POST route using Postman.# flask-full-stack-api
